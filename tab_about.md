We're one of the youngest chapters. Since we're the first in Bulgaria, we expect to grow quickly.

### Do you want to join our community?

Currently we use [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Sofia-Chapter/) as a place to talk about owasp related stuff.

If there's critical mass of people, we might set up a slack channel.

### Are you a local company that would like to volunteer a meeting spot

Would you like to share your conference room for an event? Please [contact us](mailto:mihail.stoynov@owasp.org).

Attendance is still small. The ballpark figure is 20-30 people.

### Do you have an interesting topic and would like to share

If you're interested in speaking or would like to share your expertise Please [contact us](mailto:mihail.stoynov@owasp.org).

Keep in mind that our meetings are still small and very welcoming so there's no pressure if you want to speak for a first time or feel unsure on the topic.

### Are a company that would like to sponsor us?

We use the money to buy food/beer or pay for travel/accomodation expenses when we invite non-local speakers.

Please [contact us](mailto:mihail.stoynov@owasp.org).
