### Atanas Pashov - Pros & Cons of Penetration Testing (June 27th, 2019)

In this session you will learn what is penetration testing. What are the objectives and benefits of it and at what cost. You will also learn why some vulnerabilities may not be ever discovered by automated tools. You will see only real life examples from real penetration tests, no theory, no set-ups, no fictious vulnerabilities, nothing discovered by somebody else that you can find somewhere else.

Atanas is a cloud security penetration tester at SAP LAB Bulgaria. He has more than 10 years experience in information security working in various position as an infosec manager, security officer and network and firewall administrator for huge enterprise companies in different industries like banking, service providers, pharmaceuticals and software development. He is keen on pentesting especially in infrastructure and web application perspective.
