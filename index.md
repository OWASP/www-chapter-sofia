(The talk will be in Bulgarian)

**Live Demo: Compromising Modern Online Banking Apps through Hijacking Android Devices**

In this talk Dr. Svetlin Nakov will explain and demonstrate how easily a 10-years old child can gain full control over modern European online banking apps, through hijacking an Android mobile phone, using trivial remote administration tools and screen recording apps from the official Android app store.

Finally, the speaker will give recommendations for fixing the security in online banking systems.

### Atanas Pashov - Pros & Cons of Penetration Testing (June 27th, 2019)

![Banner](assets/images/banners/2019.06.27.png)

In this session you will learn what is penetration testing. What are the objectives and benefits of it and at what cost. You will also learn why some vulnerabilities may not be ever discovered by automated tools. You will see only real life examples from real penetration tests, no theory, no set-ups, no fictious vulnerabilities, nothing discovered by somebody else that you can find somewhere else.

Atanas is a cloud security penetration tester at SAP LAB Bulgaria. He has more than 10 years experience in information security working in various position as an infosec manager, security officer and network and firewall administrator for huge enterprise companies in different industries like banking, service providers, pharmaceuticals and software development. He is keen on pentesting especially in infrastructure and web application perspective.
